  When you lack good health, everything else in life suffers. It’s harder to
  concentrate and study. Illness can cause you to fall behind in coursework.
  Stress can make you feel overwhelmed. If you want to do well in all areas of
  your life, you must make your health a priority. In the 2020 Social Progress
  Index, which measures quality of life across the globe using 50 well-being
  metrics, Americans rated themselves worse off now than they were 10 years ago.
  This data was collected before the <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic hit, which has
  only increased the nation’s need to live healthier, more balanced lives. As we
  prepare to enter a new year, you may be considering spending more time working
  on health and wellness. You don’t necessarily need an expensive gym membership
  or a diet plan to improve your health. You can get solid health and wellness
  tips from authoritative blogs. The following are some of the top wellness
  blogs in areas of fitness, nutrition, and mental health.
